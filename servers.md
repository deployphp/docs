# Servers

You can define servers with the `server` function. Here is an example of a server definition:

~~~ php
server('prod_1', 'domain.com')
    ->user('user')
    ->password('pass')
    ->env('deploy_path', '/home/www')
    ->stage('production');
    
server('prod_2', 'domain.com')
    ->user('user')
    ->password('pass')
    ->env('deploy_path', '/home/www')
    ->env('extra_stuff', '...')
    ->stage('production');
~~~

This function takes 3 parameters, like this: `server(server_name, host, port)`. It returns a `Deployer\Server\Builder` object.

To specify how to connect to server using SSH, there are a few ways:

### With a username and a password

~~~ php
server(...)
  ->user('name')
  ->password('pass')
~~~

### With a username and a typed password

~~~ php
server(...)
  ->user('name')
  ->password(null)
~~~

Set password to *null* and it will be asked.

### With an identity file

~~~ php
server(...)
    ->user('name')
    ->identityFile();
~~~

If your keys were created with a password or if they are located outside of the `.ssh` directory, you can specify the location by providing the full path:

~~~ php
server(...)
    ...
    ->identityFile('~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub', '~/.ssh/id_rsa', 'pass phrase');
~~~

### 2-factor authentication with an identity file and password or google-authenticator:

If your server is secured with 2-factor, you can connect via your private key + the sccond factor (password or google-authenticator).  Note this the current version only supports *PhpSecLib*:

~~~ php
server(...)
    ->user('name')
    ->identityFileAndPassword();
~~~

As with the normal identityFile() call, if your keys were created with a password or if they are located outside of the `.ssh` directory, you can specify the location by providing the full path:

~~~ php
server(...)
    ...
    ->identityFileAndPassword('~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub', '~/.ssh/id_rsa', 'pass phrase', 'password');
~~~

The `~` symbol  will be replaced with your home directory. 

### With a config file

Deployer can use your SSH config file.

~~~ php
server(...)
    ->user('name')
    ->configFile('/path/to/file');
~~~

### With a pem file

~~~ php
server('ec2', 'host.aws.amazon.com')
    ->user('ec2-user')
    ->pemFile('~/.ssh/keys.pem');
~~~

> Authentication using a pem file is currently only supported with PhpSecLib.

### Using PHP SSH2 extension

Package `herzult/php-ssh` is required for this to work but is not included inside `deployer.phar` so you should install `deployer/deployer` and `herzult/php-ssh` using composer:

```
composer require deployer/deployer herzult/php-ssh
```
Example `deploy.php` file:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
require 'vendor/deployer/deployer/recipe/symfony.php';

set('ssh_type', 'ext-ssh2');
//...
```
## Upload and download

You can upload a file or directory with the `upload(local, remote)` function.

You can download a file with the `download(local, remote)` function.

## Servers list

You can define servers in YAML file:

~~~ yml
prod:
  host: domain.com
  user: www
  identity_file: ~
  stage: production
  deploy_path: /home/www/
  
prod.a:
  host: a.domain.com
  user: www
  identity_file:
    public_key:  /path/to/public.key
    private_key: /path/to/private.key
    password:    optional-password-for-private-key-or-null
  stage: production
  deploy_path: /home/www/  
  
beta:
  host: beta.domain.com
  user: www
  password: pass
  stage: beta
  deploy_path: /home/www/
  
test:
  host: test.domain.com
  user: www
  password: pass
  stage: beta
  deploy_path: /home/www/  
~~~

And then in `deploy.php`:

~~~ php
serverList('servers.yml');
~~~

## Server list YAML file and environment variables

You can set environment variables per server definition. When parsing server configuration, all keys other than list below, are treated as server environment variables and can be retrieved using `env()`:

~~~ yml
  local:
  host: 
  port:
  identity_file: 
  forward_agent:
  user:
  password:
  stage:
  pem_file:
~~~

## Local Server

Also you can define *localServer*, it is run all command locally without ssh.

~~~ php
localServer(...)
    ->stage('local');
~~~

In external .yml definition the keyword `local: `can be used.

~~~ yml
development:
    local: true
    # ....
~~~

For instance, you can use it for update your local project.

## Stages

You can define every server with a stage, or list of stages:

~~~ php
server(...)
    ->stage('prod');
    
server(...)
    ->stage(['prod', 'stage']);    
    
server(...)
    ->env('stages', ['stage']);    
~~~

And then you call command `dep [task] [server or stage]`, it will be executed only on specified stage server.

It is possible to specify a default stage that will be executed if you do not give a stage on the command line. You can do this by setting the `default_stage` parameter.

~~~ php 
set('default_stage', 'staging'); 
~~~

If you run a command without specifying a stage or a default, it will be executed on the server without a specified stage.
